		<h1 class="text-vp-huge">No Man, I Don't Eat Pork</h1>

		<p>You know what you said about the structures becoming shackles. You were right and I can't take it, the injustice. I mean, no one ever's gonna know who saved the entire city.</p>

		<p class="text-vp-small">Tomorrow, you will be released. If you are bored of brawling with thieves and want to achieve something there is a rare blue flower that grows on the eastern slopes. Pick one of these flowers. If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place.</p>

		<h2 class="text-vp-large">Hero can be anyone</h2>

		<p>Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.</p>

		<p>So I had a wife. <span class="text-bold">She was beautiful,</span> like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.</p>

		<h3 class="text-vp-medium">It was a public service</h3>

		<p class="text-vp-medium">I'm here to ensure the League of Shadow fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization. You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years with all your strength, all your resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you achieved was a lie. Now, you understand? Gotham is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.</p>

		<h5 class="text-vp-small">Hero can be anyone</h5>

		<p class="text-vp-large">When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.</p>

		<p class="text-vp-huge">There is a lot of potential for huge aggressive expansion.</p>

		<h4 class="text-vp">You wanna know how I got them?</h4>

		<p>So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face.
